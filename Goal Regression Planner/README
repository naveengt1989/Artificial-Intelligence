Goal: Implement goal regression algorithm for doing planning in the Blocksworld. 

Compilation & Execution:
	Generate Operators:
		g++ genOperators.cpp
		./a.out > blocksworld.opers  

	Run Goal regression algorithm:
		g++ goalRegress.cpp
		Compilation Flags:
		-DDEBUG		-	Run algorithm with additional prints.

		./a.out blocksworld.opers init.kb
		On the prompt shown, goals to be achieved are entered separated by spaces.

	Output:
	Solution plan for problem is printed in-order of execution. Additional traces are also provided.
