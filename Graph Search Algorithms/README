Goal: Implement & compare performance graph search algorithms(BFS,DFS,GBFS) on given navigation problem i.e. path finding.

Compilation:
	g++ trackPath.cpp <FLAGS>
	Compilation flags can be the following:
	<FLAGS>
	-DBFS ==> compile enabling bfs searching algorithm
	-DDFS ==> compile enabling dfs searching algorithm
	-DGBFS ==> compile enabling gbfs searching algorithm
	-DDEBUG ==> compile in debug mode. Gives detailed print traces

Execution:
	./a.out <Input File> <Src-X Co-ordinate> <Src-Y Co-ordinate> <Destination-X Co-ordinate> <Destination-Y Co-ordinate>
	Example:
	./a.out ATM.graph 1 20 20 1 

	Output:
	By default, solution path of each search algorithm selected and summary statistics are printed. Additional prints are output in debug mode.
