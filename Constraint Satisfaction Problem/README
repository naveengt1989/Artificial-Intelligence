Goal: Backtracking search with MRV heuristics to solve constraint satisfaction problem(CSP). 

Compilation:
	g++ <FLAGS> cspBackTrack.cpp 
	Compilation Flags:
	-DMRV		-	Run algorithm with MRV Heuristics	
	-DPROB1		-	Run algorithm for Problem 1
	-DPROB2		-	Run algorithm for Problem 2
	Example: g++  -DMRV -DPROB2 cspBackTrack.cpp 
Execution:
	./a.out 

	Output:
	By default, following output is generated: Problem Solution, Number of iterations.
