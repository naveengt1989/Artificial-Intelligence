Goal: Othello competition using Minimax search, AlphaBeta Pruning(+ board eval function)

Compilation:
	g++ <FLAGS> othello.cpp 
	Compilation Flags:
	-DDEBUG		-	Run algorithm with additional prints with regard to cells being considered for next move.
	Example: g++  -DDEBUG othello.cpp 

Execution:
	./a.out <SIZE_OF_BOARD> <COLOR_CONTROLLED_BY_PROGRAM> <SEARCH_DEPTH_LIMIT> 
	Example: ./a.out 6 B 8

	Input Commands:
	Note: Commented output of the program with be preceded by the # symbol. General output syntax is as mentioned in problem statement.
	Also, input commands are case sensitive. Command names should be in lower case and color should be in upper case.

	"init" :  To be given at the start of program inorder to initialize board with center 4 cells.

	"put <Color> <Row_No> <Column_No>"  : Sets the cell specified as color specified and performs flipping and outputs resultant  
		board(commented). If move is invalid, prints: "# ERROR Invalid Move!!". Example: put B 1 2
  
	"move <Color>"  :  Runs Min-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to find next move for color specified. Outputs the move made 
		in the format: (<Row_no>, <Column_no>). If no move available, prints: "forfeit". Also outputs the resultant board(commented). 		     Example: move B  ==> (3,2).

	"reset"  :  Reset board to initial default configuration.

	"print"  :  Print Board along with heuristic values.

	"quit"   :  Stop Execution and quit program.
	
	Output:
	In case input command is not recognized, following is printed: "# Invalid option Entered!!".
