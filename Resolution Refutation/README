Goal: Solve Sammy's Sport Shop in propositional logic using resolution refutation. 

Compilation:
	g++ <FLAGS> sammy.cpp 
	Compilation Flags:
	-DDEBUG		-	Run algorithm with additional prints with regard to cells being considered for next move.
	Example: g++  -DDEBUG sammy.cpp 

Execution:
	./a.out <FILE_NAME>  
	Example: ./a.out input.txt

	Note:
	* File given as argument should contain Propositional logic in CNF form.
	* Format of input file: AX B -C  ==> AX  v B  v -C
	* Lines beginning with # are considered as comments.
	* For the problem Sammy's Sport Shop, propositional logic(in CNF form) is given in file: input.txt(included in directory).	
	
	
	Output:
	In case of success, path trace and result(SUCCESS/FAILURE) is printed. If program has been compiled with 
	-DDEBUG flag detailed prints with respect to resolution of propositional logic is also printed.
