Goal: Implement A* heuristics to solve Blocksworld problems. 

Compilation:
	g++ astarBlocksGame.cpp <FLAGS>
	Compilation Flags:
	-DDEBUG		-	Detailed prints	
Execution:
	./a.out <NUMBER OF STACKS> <NUMBER OF BLOCKS>
	Example:
	./a.out 5 8 

	On input, problem generator generates a random initial state with specified number of blocks, stacks.
	Output:
	Solution path of each the blocks game, i.e. each state from initial state to goal state and summary statistics(number of iterations, maximum queue size, path length) are printed.
